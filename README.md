## YPU

##### Overview

A toy CPU based on tomasulo algorithm, supporting part of RV32I Instruction set.

#### 

##### Technical Features

- Tomasulo architecture with Reorder Buffer.
- Hardware Speculation and precise interruption, supported by 2-bit saturating counter predictor of 1024 entries.
- Directly-mapped instruction cache of 2048 entries.
- Reorder buffer of 16 entries.
- Well performance with relatively less hardware overhead.
- Pass all testcases on simulation and FPGA.
